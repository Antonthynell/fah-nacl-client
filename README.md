fah-nacl-client
===============

This project contains the source code for the Open-Source frontend of
the Folding@home NaCl Client.  This client requires the Google Chrome
browser which can be downloaded here: https://google.com/chrome/.  You
can run the client either from the Chrome Web Store:
https://chrome.google.com/webstore or by going directly to
http://folding.stanford.edu/nacl/.

# Team URLs
You can now recruit team members with URLs like this:
  http://folding.stanford.edu/nacl/?team=1234.

If the user does not already have a team then it will set their team
automatically. If they do have a team set then it will ask them first.
